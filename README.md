# Overview
For a more detailed walkthrough and explanation of this repository, view the rendered `.qmd` file. For the actual `template repository` visit [uv-project-template](https://www.github.com/ChrisKornaros/uv-project-template.git). 

The goal of this repository is simply to teach and provide a walkthrough, with more detailed notes than the average Open Source documentation would. Additionally, this will include tools besides `uv` in the workflow (which is normal for a project/package manager) and add explanations where, normally, it's assumed the reader has the same background knowledge as the writer. So, I'll add a few things in here that I ran into, and explain my thought process for handling it that way.
